# üìä Programming Language Popularity Over Time

This project visualizes the monthly popularity trends of various programming languages, based on the number of related questions and posts on a major Q&A platform (Stack Overflow).

The analysis uses **Pandas** for data cleaning and time-series manipulation, and **Matplotlib** for creating a large, detailed line plot to show the long-term trends between approximately 2008 and 2020.

## ‚ú® Visualization Result

The resulting graph clearly illustrates significant shifts in the technology landscape, particularly the rise of Python and JavaScript, and the sustained presence of established languages like C# and Java.

### Key Observations:

* **Python's Dominance:** Python shows the steepest, most sustained growth, becoming the most popular language by the end of the timeline.

* **JavaScript's Momentum:** JavaScript maintains high popularity and shows strong growth, often tracking closely with Python's trend.

* **Smoothed Data:** A 3-period rolling mean was applied to the raw monthly data to smooth out noise and highlight the underlying long-term trends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

The repository contains three primary files:

| File Name | Description | 
 | ----- | ----- | 
| **`QueryResults.csv`** | The raw, time-series data containing the monthly post counts for each language tag. | 
| **`main.ipynb`** | The complete Jupyter Notebook containing the Python script for data cleaning, pivoting, smoothing, and generating the final `image_e7cffc.jpg` plot. | 
| **`image_e7cffc.jpg`** | The final high-resolution visualization generated by the script. | 

## üöÄ How to Run the Notebook

To explore and execute this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/Parv-hokage/Programming-Language-Popularity-Visualised
cd Programming-Language-Popularity-Visualised
2. **Install Dependencies:**
You need **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **Jupyter**.
pip install pandas matplotlib jupyter


3. **Open and Execute the Notebook:**
Launch the Jupyter server and open the notebook file:
jupyter notebook
Navigate to and open **`main.ipynb`**. You can then run all cells to reproduce the analysis and plot.
